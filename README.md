# hello-world

The purpose of Git is to manage a project, or a set of files, as they change over time. Git stores this information in a data structure called a repository.

A git repository contains, among other things, the following:

A set of commit objects.
A set of references to commit objects, called heads.
The Git repository is stored in the same directory as the project itself, in a subdirectory called .git. Note differences from central-repository systems like CVS or Subversion:

There is only one .git directory, in the root directory of the project.
The repository is stored in files alongside the project. There is no central server repository.
